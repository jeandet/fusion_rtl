# AnalogTwo FPGA firmware

This folder contains the FPGA sources to bridge the Fusion board to the AnalogTwo daughter board.
It is written using LiteX, to generate the bitstream, just type make (assuming you have podman and built the image into the docker folder).

At the moment the code is quite rudimentary, read it, hack it!
